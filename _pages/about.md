* I am a Junior Lecturer in the [Accounting Department](http://akuntansi.polines.ac.id/) at [Politeknik Negeri Semarang](https://www.polines.ac.id/). [[Curriculum Vitae]](http://wafamansur.com/files/wafamansur_cv.pdf)
* I received my Bachelor’s Degree in [Politeknik Negeri Semarang](https://www.polines.ac.id/). My undergraduate research advisors is [Prof. Tzong-Chen Wu  吳宗成](https://www.cs.ntust.edu.tw/index.php/en/introduction-3/group-c/tzong-chen-wu) ([National Taiwan University of Science and Technology](https://www-e.ntust.edu.tw/)).
* My research interests lie in the general area of information security, particularly in Cryptography, Computer and Data Security, System Analysis and Design.
